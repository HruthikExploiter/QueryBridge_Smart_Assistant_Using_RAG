# QueryBridge: Smart Assistant Using RAG

QueryBridge is a smart assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide intelligent, source-backed answers from uploaded documents or URLs. It combines the power of LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, FAISS vector search, and LLMs (via Groq API) with a FastAPI backend.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
gh repo clone HruthikExploiter/QueryBridge_Smart_Assistant_Using_RAG
cd QueryBridge_Smart_Assistant_Using_RAG-main
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set up your `.env` file
Create a `.env` file in `model/`:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

---

## ▶️ Running the App

### Backend (FastAPI)
```bash
cd FastAPI_Server
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

---

## 🧪 API Usage

### Health Check
`GET /`  
Response:
```json
{ "message": "FastAPI is running." }
```

### Ask a Question
`POST /ask`  
Request:
```json
{ "query": "What are 30-year mortgage rates?" }
```
Response:
```json
{
  "answer": "30-year mortgage rates are ...",
  "sources": "https://example.com"
}
```

## 📌 Notes

- The vector DB persists across runs unless reset.
- To delete source-specific content, call the `delete_documents_by_source()` function (e.g., inside a Streamlit app or separate API).
- All `.txt`, `.csv`, and URL data are chunked and embedded for semantic search.
