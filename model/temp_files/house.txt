The housing market in 2025 is showing signs of stabilization after several years of volatility. 
With interest rates plateauing, buyers are slowly returning to the market. Inventory remains tight in major cities, 
but suburban and rural areas are experiencing growth in new listings. 
Government incentives for first-time homebuyers are also contributing to increased activity.

Experts believe that the market will continue to balance out, with modest price increases expected through the rest of the year. 
As remote work continues to influence housing decisions, hybrid workplace policies are shaping demand in mid-sized towns and regions.
